This python program enables the user to enter a DNA sequence (made up of nucleotides) and analyse/change it using the following functions:

1 - Nucleotide count and percentages

2 - Split the sequence by a letter

3 - Split the sequence into groups of a given size

4 - Give the nucleotide in a given position

5 - Delete a given letter

6 - Delete one or more nucleotide in a given position

7 - Identify if a given pattern exists

8 - Give the amount of times a given pattern exists

9 - Replace all occurrences of a given letter

10 - Replace a letter in a given position

11 - Randomly create a DNA sequence of a given length

It is a work-in-progress and currently successsfully carries out functions 1-5
